/** LooperClip
 * Represents each clip that a looper can playback. The core of the audio
 * samples is stored in AudioBuffer objects which are dynamically resized. The
 * base size of a AudioBuffer is 1 second's worth, after which larger buffers
 * will be requested.
 * The transition between AudioBuffer instances is seamless: when the clip is
 * running out, the new one is requested. Upon its arrival the current data is
 * copied, and the old buffer is returned for deallocation.
 *
 * This system allows for arbitrary length recordings, without huge
 * pre-allocated buffers while it is still quite simple.
 *
 * Each clip has its properties like length and bars/beats, so the Looper knows
 * to dynamically stretch / process the audio appropriately. Controllers and the
 * UI are updated from this data.
 *
 * This class inherits from SaveAble to save its state.
